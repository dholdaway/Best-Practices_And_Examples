# What is GDPR

## Overview
- GDPR is a new data protection law that takes effect on 25th May 2018.
- It stands for _General Data Protection Regulation_.
- In the UK, it replaces the _Data Protection Act 1998_.
- It affects any business that holds data of European citizens.
	- For example: it means that it affects US businesses that have EU customers.
- It affects and applies to the UK even after Brexit.
- It's a huge legal framework and applies to any use of data - it's not just a website thing.
- It enshrines Article 8 of the European Charter of Human Rights, the "Right to respect for private and family life".

## Fines
Getting GDPR wrong could be costly. The upper-limit for fines will be €20 million or 4% or annual turnover. Yikes.
