# The Lingo

## Broad Legal Terms
- **Directive**: Where Europe tells member states to implement their version of a law how they want under general guidelines.
- **Regulation**: Law implemented consistently across the EU on the same date.
- **Lex Specialis**: The specialised law overrules the general one (ePR overrules GDPR).

## GDPR Terms
- **Pseudonymisation**: Taking real data and changing it so it's not directly identifiable. For example, instead of having the customer's name in a database you have a unique ID for them. Because it's less identifiable, there's less risk attached.
- **Personal data**: Any data related to an identifiable person - including things like IP addresses and corporate email addresses.
- **Sensitive Personal data**: Things like genetic and biometric data. Hopefully not applicable to most sites!
- **Data-controller**: _The_ individual or organisation that ultimately collects and is in control about the how and why data is processed. For client work, this is nearly always the client.
- **Data-processor**: _An_ individual or organisation which processes data on behalf of the controller. If you host a site, you're a data processor. If you rent a VPN to host that site, they're a data processor. If you use Google Analytics to track, they're a data processor.
