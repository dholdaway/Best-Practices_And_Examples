# The Basic Principles

## Overview
The overarching point of GDPR is that individuals should be in control of their data. We don't have a right to take and use (or misuse) data without their permission.

In essense, the law is about respect. Respecting our customers and our visitors enough to treat their intimate and identifiable data with diligence and integrity.

In the web community, we're often guilty of 'dark patterns' and general naughtiness to grab as many leads, points of data, or sales as possible.

With GDPR there'll be a correction back to responsible use of data, and our industry should mature a little.

It's good for all of us as individuals, but for us as professionals there's a bunch of things to learn and work to do. Let's get started...

## Individual's Rights
https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/

### 1. The Right To Be Informed
People have a right to be informed about what data they're giving and how it will be used.

This should be communicated in a plain-English privacy policy. We have further documentation on our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/madebymutual/GDPR-ePR-Guide/blob/master/en/privacy-policy.md) notes.

### 2. The Right Of Access
People have a right to see what data you have of them. Data-controllers need to give them their data free-of-charge within one month. The data should be given in an understandable format.

If someone is asking for _really complicated_ requests, or ask you for it frequently then you can charge a 'reasonable fee'. There's little guidance about what that actually means, though.

### 3. The Right To Rectification
People have the right to rectify their data if it's wrong, out-dated, or incomplete. The data-controller must respond within a month.

### 4. The Right To Erasure
This is a big one for us webbies and is covered on our [Right To Be Forgotten](https://github.com/madebymutual/GDPR-ePR-Guide/blob/master/en/the-right-to-be-forgotten.md) page.


### 5. The Right To Restrict Processing
People have a right to force a data controller not to process data under one or more of the following circumstances:-

1. Where the person thinks the data is wrong
2. Where the person objects to the processing
3. Where the processing is unlawful
4. If you no longer need to use the data, but the individual needs you to keep it for some reason

If someone requests this, then the data-controller should let data-processors know.

An example of this may be that a customer asks for their records not to be processed in a CRM if they think their data is wrong.

### 6. The Right To Data Portability
This one only applies if a person has given data and it's processed automatically with their consent or to serve a contract. The ICO gives an example of Banks allowing the portability of data via [midata](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-midata-vision-of-consumer-empowerment).

But if it does affect you - people should be able to take data held on them and move it to somewhere else.

Common formats like CSV, JSON, XML are good formats for providing data. They're machine readable, so the new destination can read it if they know how.

The data controller must provided this information free of charge and within a month - so make sure that you have export tools ready for any data your website controls if this applies to you.

### 7. The Right To Object
TODO

### 8. "Rights related to automated decision making including profiling"
TODO
