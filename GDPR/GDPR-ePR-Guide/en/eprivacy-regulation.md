# What is the ePrivacy Regulation?

## Overview
The ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) sits alongside the GDPR and is meant to come in on the same day (25th May 2018).

It replaces the ePrivacy _Directive_ (better known as "The Cookie Law").

Where GDPR focuses on personal data, ePR focuses on _all_ digital data, personal or not.

## What law?
ePR is _lex specialis_. That's legal talk for, _"this one's specific, so it overrules the broad one"_.

So you follow GDPR unless ePR clarifies or builds on any points. So where possible, this guide will highlight both what GDPR wants, and also what we currently understand about how ePR would be implemented.


## Where's it at?
It's unclear whether this law will be ready. In January 2018, only a few month from when it's meant to become law, it's still in draft stage.

This makes it really tricky for us to be ready for the law because:-

1. We don't know exactly _what_ it will be.
2. We don't know exactly _when_ it will be.

But fret not. If we follow GDPR, then hopefully only good tweaks will be needed for ePR. And with any luck, clarification on ePR will be around the corner.

## Fines
The fines are the same as GDPR - the upper-limit will be €20 million or 4% or annual turnover.
